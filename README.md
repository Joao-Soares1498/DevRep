# CCA - Evaluation Coordinating Council

### This was one of the project I developed in the last semester of my bachelors.

**Some requirements were asked to be developed for the discipline evaluation and after evaluation, the teacher proposed me to continue to develop the project further. Some more features were added but in the end the project was dropped. So here is the code developed until that point.**

The objective was to create a web aplication that follows some rules to simplify the teacher evaluation made by the council.

To access the functionalities was created an **authentication system** based on roles.

After authentication users can navigate a page to insert all data and create a new evaluation. The data that was typed and confirmed is sent to the back-end inserted in a excel model file and a copy is saved in an user personal folder.

If needed the user can create a pdf version of the finalized excel document.

User on his main page can access all of the finilized docs and download if he desires to.
